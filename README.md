# Containerz - gNOI Container Service

Containerz defines an interface via which containers can be deployed to network
devices from an external client. This interface can be used to deploy, start,
stop, list containers and obtain logs for containers running on the target
system. The containerz interface is defined [here](https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/containerz/containerz.proto).

# Disclaimer

The protocol definition as well as the current implementation should still
be considered unstable as breaking changes could be introduced.

This is not an official Google product.
